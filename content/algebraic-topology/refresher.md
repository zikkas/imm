Algebraic Topology is based on two big subjects (as the name suggests), General Topology and Abstract Algebra.

## 1. General Topology

The most critical concept for this course is the **Quotient Topology**, as almost all interesting spaces are constructed as quotients.

### Key Concepts to Review

- **Continuous Functions:** Preimages of open sets are open.
- **Homeomorphisms:** Bijective continuous maps with continuous inverses.
- **Quotient Spaces:**
  - Identifying points ($x \sim y$).
  - The Quotient Topology definition.
- **Compactness & Connectedness:**
  - Image of compact/connected sets.
  - The difference between Connected and Path-Connected.

## 2. Algebra

You need to know how to manipulate the algebra.

### Group Theory

- **Free Groups:** Generators and relations.
- **Quotient Groups:** Normal subgroups and the First Isomorphism Theorem.
- **Abelian Groups:** Structure theorem for Finitely Generated Abelian Groups.

### Exact Sequences

This might be new to you. It is the engine of Homology.

- **Definition:** A sequence $A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C$ is exact if $\text{Im}(f) = \text{Ker}(g)$.
- **Short Exact Sequences:** $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$.
