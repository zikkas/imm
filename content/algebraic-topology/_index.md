# Algebraic Topology

## Course Syllabus

_Note: This structure is based on standard graduate curricula and is subject to change by the professors._

### Part I: The Fundamental Group

- **Homotopy:** Paths, homotopies of paths, and the definition of $\pi_1(X)$.
- **Covering Spaces:** Path lifting, the Monodromy Action, and the Galois correspondence for covering spaces.
- **Van Kampen's Theorem:** Computing the fundamental group of cell complexes and unions of spaces.

### Part II: Homology Theory

- **Simplicial & Singular Homology:** Definitions and the proof that they coincide.
- **Computations:** Exact sequences, Relative Homology, and the Excision Theorem.
- **Mayer-Vietoris Sequence:** The primary tool for computing homology groups of complex spaces.
