## 1. Algebra

You must have good command of the language of rings and fields.

- **Galois Theory:** Fundamental theorem, field extensions, and separable/normal extensions.
- **Ring Theory:** Unique Factorization Domains (UFDs), Principal Ideal Domains (PIDs), and Euclidean Domains.
- **Modules:** Basics of modules over a PID (structure theorem).
- **Group Theory:** Finite abelian groups and structure theorems.

## 2. Analysis (For Analytic Number Thoery)

The analytic section behaves like a complex analysis course disguised as number theory.

- **Complex Analysis:** Holomorphic functions, contour integration, Cauchy's residue theorem.
- **Series and Products:** Convergence of infinite series and products (essential for Euler products).
- **Asymptotics:** Big-O notation and asymptotic growth of functions.
