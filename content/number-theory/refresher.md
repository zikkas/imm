# Preparing for Advanced Number Theory

Advanced Number Theory draws heavily from several other branches of mathematics. To survive this course, you should be comfortable with the following foundations.

## 1. Algebra (Essential)

You must have good command of the language of rings and fields.

- **Galois Theory:** Fundamental theorem, field extensions, and separable/normal extensions.
- **Ring Theory:** Unique Factorization Domains (UFDs), Principal Ideal Domains (PIDs), and Euclidean Domains.
- **Modules:** Basics of modules over a PID (structure theorem).
- **Group Theory:** Finite abelian groups and structure theorems.

## 2. Analysis (For Analytic NT)

The analytic section behaves like a complex analysis course disguised as number theory.

- **Complex Analysis:** Holomorphic functions, contour integration, Cauchy's residue theorem.
- **Series & Products:** Convergence of infinite series and products (essential for Euler products).
- **Asymptotics:** Big-O notation and asymptotic growth of functions.

## 3. Linear Algebra & Geometry (For Geometric NT)

- **Vector Spaces:** Basis, dimension, and linear transformations.
- **Inner Product Spaces:** Norms, orthogonality, and Gram-Schmidt process.
- **Topology:** Basic point-set topology (compactness, open/closed sets) in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
