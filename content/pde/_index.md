# Partial Differential Equations

_Note: This structure is based on standard graduate curricula and is subject to change by the professors._

This course offers a rigorous treatment of Differential Equations (specially Partial Differential Equations) using the framework of Functional Analysis and Semi-Groups. It will focuses on existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions for broad classes of equations. We view PDEs as evolution equations in infinite-dimensional spaces, allowing us to treat the Heat Equation, Wave Equation, and Schrödinger Equation under a single mathematical theory.

## Course Syllabus

### Part I: Foundations

- **Banach & Hilbert Spaces:** Review of core tools (completeness, dual spaces).
- **Unbounded Operators:** Domains, closed operators, and the spectrum.
- **The Abstract Cauchy Problem:** Formulating PDEs as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in Banach spaces ($u_t = Au$).

### Part II: Parabolic Equations (Heat Type)

- **Analytic Theory:** Smoothing effects and regularity of solutions.
- **Applications:** The Heat Equation in bounded and unbounded domains.
- **Asymptotic Behavior:** Decay rates and stability of solutions as $t \to \infty$.

### Part III: Hyperbolic Equations (Wave Type)

- **Hyperbolicity conditions:** Energy methods and conservation laws.
- **The Wave Equation:** Existence of solutions and finite speed of propagation.
- **Perturbation Theory:** Handling lower-order terms and boundary conditions.
