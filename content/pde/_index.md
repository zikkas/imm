# Partial Differential Equations

This course tackles topics on the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions for differential equations from a mathematical view-point. This will be done through 2 big topics. First through Operator Theory, specifically unbounded operators (since differentition and integration are unbounded). Second through Operators Semi-Groups Theory, since all differential equations have flows and those flows generate semi-groups. After finishing with those two topics, the course will cover how to use both of those topics to solve Differential Equations in general and PDEs (Partial Differential Equation) specifically.
