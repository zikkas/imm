# Partial Differential Equations

This course offers a rigorous treatment of time-dependent Partial Differential Equations using the framework of Functional Analysis. It will focuses on existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions for broad classes of equations. We view PDEs as evolution equations in infinite-dimensional spaces, allowing us to treat the Heat Equation, Wave Equation, and Schrödinger Equation under a unified mathematical theory.

## Course Syllabus

### Part I: Foundations

- **Banach & Hilbert Spaces:** Review of core tools (completeness, dual spaces).
- **Unbounded Operators:** Domains, closed operators, and the spectrum.
- **The Abstract Cauchy Problem:** Formulating PDEs as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in Banach spaces ($u_t = Au$).

### Part II: Parabolic Equations (Heat Type)

- **Analytic Theory:** Smoothing effects and regularity of solutions.
- **Applications:** The Heat Equation in bounded and unbounded domains.
- **Asymptotic Behavior:** Decay rates and stability of solutions as $t \to \infty$.

### Part III: Hyperbolic Equations (Wave Type)

- **Hyperbolicity conditions:** Energy methods and conservation laws.
- **The Wave Equation:** Existence of solutions and finite speed of propagation.
- **Perturbation Theory:** Handling lower-order terms and boundary conditions.
