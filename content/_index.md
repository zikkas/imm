{{% notice note "Maintainer's Note" %}}
**This is an individual initiative.**

This website is currently maintained and curated by a single student. While I strive for accuracy, correctness and rigor in all notes and summaries, errors can happen. I am only human after all

**This project is open to debate and improvement.**

If you find a mistake, have a better summary for a topic, or want to suggest a change to the structure, please reach out or open an issue on the repository. Your feedback is vital to making this a reliable resource for all of us.
